# DecimalPercentages

Adds decimal points to percentages everywhere you can think of (Hopefully.):
- Main levels selection menu <cy>(Note: has yet to be tested with Main Levels Editor by user666)</c>
- Level lists and level browsing menus
- Pause menu (including Editor levels)
- "New Best" screens
- Best scores shown in % progress text <cy>(Note: requires a mod menu with a "Best in Percentage" feature)</c>

<cy>_***Note:***_</c> *<cy>For those who have</c> <cl>DeathScreenTweaks</c><cy>, you are welcome to leave the</c> <cl>"Accurate Percentages"</c> <cy>toggle setting to whatever you like; DecimalPercentages will try its best to be compatible in any case.</c>*

Most of this mod's code, including how this mod stores level percentages, was written by TheSillyDoggo. Then life happened, as well as a few bug reports.

Mod idea by [levigaming1248](https://discord.com/users/1054183308042440706).

Much like EvenMoreLevelTags, this [Geode mod](https://geode-sdk.org) is a (consenting) continuation of TheSillyDoggo's (unfinished) "Decimal Percentages" mod, and is licensed under the LGPLv2 license.
