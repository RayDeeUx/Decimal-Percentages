# DecimalPercentages

### <cy>As seen on</c> <c-ff0000>You</c>Tube<c-ffff55>!</c> ([Hqmy](https://youtube.com/watch?v=AO--mVVFtKI&t=23), Every End 79.62%)

Adds decimal points to percentages everywhere you can think of <cy>(also read the notes below this list!)</c>:
- Main levels selection menu
- Level lists and level browsing menus
- Pause menu (including Editor levels)
- "New Best" screens
- Best scores shown in percentage (%) label <cy>(Requires a mod menu with a "Best in Percentage" feature enabled for full effect)</c>
- Editor levels <cy>(MarioMastr's [Progress in Editor Levels](mod:mariomastr.progress_of_editor_levels) required)</c>

<cr>_***Note:***_</c> *<cr>As there are roughly five competing mod menus on the Geode index as of publishing this mod (and a vanilla in-game toggle), this mod will not add decimal points to the text displaying your current percentage while playing a level.</c>*

<cy>_***Note:***_</c> *<cy>For those who have</c> <cl>DeathScreenTweaks</c><cy>, you are welcome to leave the</c> <cl>"Accurate Percentages"</c> <cy>toggle setting to whatever you like; DecimalPercentages will try its best to be compatible in any case.</c>*

_***Note:***_ *By default, this mod allows (at most) three decimal points when viewing online levels, saved online levels, and levels in level lists. Enable <cl>"Insane Mode"</c> in the mod settings to disable this limit.*

Most of this mod's code, including how this mod stores level percentages, was written by TheSillyDoggo. Then life happened, as well as a few bug reports.

Mod idea by [levigaming1248](https://discord.com/users/1054183308042440706). A salute to [at4pm](https://github.com/at4pm) for attempting this mod. <cl>o7</c>

This [Geode mod](https://geode-sdk.org) is a (consenting) continuation of TheSillyDoggo's (unfinished) "Decimal Percentages" mod, and is licensed under the LGPLv2 license.
