Most of this mod's code, including how this mod stores level percentages, was written by TheSillyDoggo. Then life happened, as well as a few bug reports.

Much like EvenMoreLevelTags, this [Geode mod](https://geode-sdk.org) is a (consenting) continuation of TheSillyDoggo's (unfinished) "Decimal Percentages" mod, and is licensed under the LGPLv2 license. To report bugs or get help with using my mods, press the Discord button in the lower left corner.
