Adds decimal points to percentages everywhere you can think of. (Hopefully.)

***Note:*** *For those who have DeathScreenTweaks, you are welcome to leave the "Accurate Percentages" toggle setting to whatever you like; DecimalPercentages will try its best to be compatible in any case.*

Most of this mod's code, including how this mod stores level percentages, was written by TheSillyDoggo. Then life happened, as well as a few bug reports.

Much like EvenMoreLevelTags, this [Geode mod](https://geode-sdk.org) is a (consensual) continuation of TheSillyDoggo's (unfinished) "Decimal Percentages" mod, and is licensed under the LGPLv2 license.
